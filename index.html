        <h3>story</h3>

        <p class="firstpara">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to
            commiserate. They said, <q>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.”</q>The farmer
            said, "<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in
            the
            evening everybody
            came back and said, <q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q>
            The farmer
            again
            said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</p> <br>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q>“Oh dear, that’s too <section class="bad">bad</section>,”</q> and the farmer
            responded,
            “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the
            conscription
            officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken
            leg.
            Again
            all the neighbors came around and said, <q>“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
        </p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <section class="good">good</section> or <section class="bad">bad
            </section> — because you
            never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <section class="good">good</section>
            fortune.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        <section class="good">good</section> and <section class="bad">bad</section> are just one perspective. Bananas
        are <section class="good">good
        </section> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <section class="good">good</section> for bananas. Let's
        not
        make a big deal out of it...
